https://infosec.cs.umass.edu/content/compsci-461661-secure-distributed-systems
This is a class devoted to the study of securing distributed systems, with decentralized digital currencies serving as our real platform of interest. Examples of such decentralized systems include Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are both open source, the subject of great academic interest, and supporting an enormous user base. 

We'll start with the fundamentals of Lamport's, Fischer's, and Douceur's results that fence-in consensus systems, including blockchains. We'll also look at the efficiency of the network architectures for peer-to-peer communication and attacks on their security (e.g., eclipse and other denial of service attacks). And we'll review applied crypto such as elliptical curves (used to validate transactions). Other topics include privacy, economics, and finance.
